Large motors use star-delta starter (reduces starting current to 1/3) or auto-transformer starter." },

      { q:"What is a megger and what does it measure?", a:"A megger (insulation resistance tester) measures the resistance of insulation in MΩ. Applies a high DC voltage (500V or 1000V). Low insulation resistance indicates moisture, damage or degradation. Read after 1 minute for the polarisation index test." },

      <h3>Fundamentals of DC Circuit Analysis</h3>
      <p>A <strong>DC circuit</strong> carries current that flows in only one direction — from the higher potential terminal (positive) to the lower (negative) through the external circuit. All marine engineers must master DC circuit analysis because <strong>battery systems</strong>, <strong>emergency lighting</strong>, <strong>starter motors</strong>, and <strong>control circuits</strong> on board ships operate on DC.</p>

      <p>The foundation of all circuit analysis is <strong>Ohm's Law</strong>: <code>V = I × R</code>, where V is the voltage (volts), I is the current (amperes), and R is the resistance (ohms). This deceptively simple equation governs everything from calculating fuse ratings for a 24V navigation light circuit to sizing conductors for a 110V DC emergency switchboard.</p>

      <h3>Kirchhoff's Laws — The Two Pillars</h3>
      <p><strong>Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL)</strong> states that the algebraic sum of all voltages around any closed loop equals zero: <code>ΣV = 0</code>. This is based on the conservation of energy — the energy gained by charges (from EMF sources) must equal the energy lost (across resistors).</p>
      <p><strong>Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL)</strong> states that the sum of currents entering any junction equals the sum leaving: <code>ΣI_in = ΣI_out</code>. This is conservation of charge — no charge is created or destroyed at a junction.</p>

      <div class="learn-callout example">
        <span class="learn-callout-label">🚢 Real Example</span>
        On a typical cargo vessel's 24V DC emergency system, a parallel circuit feeds navigation lights (port, starboard, masthead, stern). If the total current drawn is 8.5A and one 2A masthead light fails open-circuit, KCL tells us the remaining branches will still carry their individual currents unchanged (6.5A total), because <strong>voltage across parallel branches is the same</strong>.
      </div>

      <h3>Network Theorems</h3>
      <p><strong>Thevenin's Theorem</strong> is the most powerful simplification tool: any linear two-terminal network can be replaced by a single voltage source V_th in series with a resistance R_th. To find V_th, measure the <strong>open-circuit voltage</strong> across the terminals. To find R_th, <strong>short all voltage sources</strong> (replace with short circuits) and <strong>open all current sources</strong>, then calculate the resistance seen from the terminals.</p>
      <p><strong>Norton's Theorem</strong> is the dual: same network becomes a current source I_N in parallel with R_N. The relationship is <code>I_N = V_th / R_th</code> and <code>R_N = R_th</code>.</p>
      <p>The <strong>Superposition Theorem</strong> applies to circuits with multiple sources: the response (current/voltage) due to multiple sources equals the sum of responses due to each source acting alone, with all other sources deactivated.</p>

      <div class="learn-callout warning">
        <span class="learn-callout-label">⚠️ Common Mistake</span>
        When applying superposition, students often forget that <em>deactivating a voltage source means short-circuiting it</em> (replacing with a wire), while <em>deactivating a current source means open-circuiting it</em> (removing the branch). Getting this backwards leads to completely wrong results.

      <h3>Power in DC Circuits</h3>
      <p>Electrical power has three equivalent forms: <code>P = V × I = I²R = V²/R</code> (all in watts). The <code>I²R</code> form is crucial for calculating <strong>conductor heating losses</strong> — this is why marine cable sizing standards (IEC 60092) mandate minimum cross-sections: thinner cables mean higher resistance, more I²R heating, and fire risk.</p>

      <div class="learn-callout oral">
        <span class="learn-callout-label">📝 MMD Oral Question</span>
        <strong>Q: A 220V DC motor draws 45A. The cable resistance from switchboard to motor is 0.15Ω total. Calculate the voltage at motor terminals and power lost in cables.</strong><br>
        A: Voltage drop = I × R_cable = 45 × 0.15 = 6.75V. Motor terminal voltage = 220 − 6.75 = <strong>213.25V</strong>. Cable power loss = I²R = 45² × 0.15 = <strong>303.75W</strong>. This is why cable runs should be as short as possible.
      </div>

      <div class="learn-callout tip">
        <span class="learn-callout-label">💡 Exam Tip</span>
        For competitive exams and oral boards, always write all three forms of the power equation. Examiners often test whether you know when to use which form — use <strong>P = V × I</strong> when both V and I are known, <strong>P = I²R</strong> when current and resistance are known (cable loss calculations), and <strong>P = V²/R</strong> when voltage and resistance are known (heater ratings).

      { q:"A ship has GM = 0.5m. What does this mean and is it adequate?", a:"GM=0.5m: ship is positively stable (upright if undisturbed, returns to upright after heeling). Minimum IMO intact stability: GM ≥ 0.15m and GZ ≥ 0.20m at 30°. However GM<0.15m: tender (slow, uncomfortable rolling). GM>1.0m: stiff (short, violent rolling — crew fatigue, cargo shifting). Optimal: 0.2-0.6m depending on ship type." },
      { q:"How does adding ballast water affect GM?", a:"Adding ballast in double bottom tanks: lowers KG (weight goes down) → GM increases. But: free surface of ballast water → free surface correction (reduces GM). And: extra weight increases displacement → KB rises slightly. Net effect depends on where ballast added. Filling tanks completely eliminates free surface correction." },

      { q:"Compare induction and synchronous motors.", a:"Induction: simpler, cheaper, self-starting, speed drops under load (slip), always lagging PF. Synchronous: constant speed (no slip), can correct PF (leading), cannot self-start, more expensive, needs DC excitation. Ships use induction for most applications, synchronous for large loads where PF correction needed." },
      { q:"What is a telemotor system?", a:"Hydraulic remote control system connecting bridge steering wheel to steering gear in steering flat. Transmitter (bridge) converts wheel movement to hydraulic pressure. Receiver (steering flat) converts hydraulic signal to mechanical movement of steering gear control valve.

      { q:"How does a brushless alternator work?", a:"Main alternator has stationary field (stator) and rotating armature (rotor). Exciter is reversed — rotating field, stationary armature. Rotating diodes on shaft rectify exciter AC output to DC for main field. No brushes or slip rings needed — more reliable, less maintenance." },
      { q:"What happens if you try to parallel generators that are out of sync?", a:"If voltage/frequency/phase don't match: massive circulating current flows between generators → severe mechanical shock to couplings → possible breaker trip on overcurrent → generator damage → potential blackout.

Bus section breaker allows splitting into independent sections for redundancy." },
      { q:"What voltage levels are used on ships?", a:"440V 60Hz 3-phase: standard for most ships. 6.6kV: large ships (cruise, container) for high-power motors. 220V: lighting, domestic. 24V DC: emergency, navigation lights, control circuits. 110V: portable tools (safety).

      { q:"Difference between a contactor and a circuit breaker?", a:"Contactor: designed for frequent switching of motor loads, rated for making/breaking normal load current only.

    ],
    flashcards:[
      { q:"How does a star-delta starter work?", a:"Start in STAR: each winding gets V_line/√3 voltage → starting current reduced to 1/3 of DOL. Timer switches to DELTA: each winding gets full V_line → motor runs at full power. Transition causes current transient. Motor must reach >75% speed in star before switching." },
      { q:"What is a soft starter and its advantages?", a:"Uses thyristors (SCRs) to gradually increase voltage to motor from 0 to full over 5–30 seconds. Smooth start — no mechanical shock, no current surge. Also provides soft stop. More expensive than star-delta but better performance. Used for: compressors, pumps, fans on modern ships." },

      { q:"What precautions when connecting shore supply?", a:"Check: voltage (440V/380V), frequency (50/60Hz), phase sequence (same rotation). Use shore connection box with interlock. Open main breaker first. Connect shore cable. Check phase sequence with meter. Close shore breaker. Monitor voltage and frequency. Ensure proper earthing connection." },
